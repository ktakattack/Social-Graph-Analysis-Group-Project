###Project Overview
The goal was to provide a network anaylsis of a dataset. Our idea was to incorporate a recipe and ingredient dataset found on Kaggle (see sources). Through this particular dataset,
we could see what ingredient correlated to cuisines. This made us ask if forming a network on this dataset could help expand a users' palettes and showing connections to 
new cuisines based on their existing favorite foods.
<br>
For the network analysis part, the data was imported and we used Python and Jupyter notebook to start looking for insights.
###Web App
For the purposes of presenting our project to our instructor and class, we created a web app using Flask as our framework.

####Libraries used: <em>Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, NTLK, Gemsim, Pickle, Scikitlearn</em>
